t0:
  Talk to us about the evolution of Linux vx over the years - what was it like 
  when there wasn't the wealth of documentation there is today, what discoveries
  in this area inspired you, and where do you see it going?

herm1t:
  The articles by Silvio Cesare and grugq helped a lot, as well as Tracy Reed's
  mailing list. There were also a few encounters with Bliss and some other early
  viruses on production systems I was working at. As for documentation, I share
  the early OSS attitude "read the source, Luke", it's the best kind of 
  documentation. Though the hacking scene of 90s and early 2000s captured my 
  imagination I was shy and thought that nobody is interested in my little hobby
  and am was slowly progressing through technicalities until counterintelligence
  and police knocked at my door.

t0:
  Were you in undernet #vir / #virus in the late 90's ?

herm1t:
  I tried :-) But with my lousy language skills and being unable to explain why
  am I here, I got quickly banned from chans, just to return and quietly listen
  and being bored by endless and unrelated chit-chats.

t0:
  Tell us about the evolution of your own ELF vx writing - what techniques did 
  you use first, what did you do next, what was the hardest technique you did?
  or the one you are most proud of?

herm1t:
  The most significant thing I learnt that you don't need assembly to get the 
  things right (But you should learn asm anyway). As real-coderz-use-asm dude 
  I reproduced Silvio's segment thing in asm and continued in the same way for
  years until I realized that low-level stuff is unnecessary. One can easily 
  inject the code filelessly from memory, find imports and all such stuff 
  without even bother about insns length and such, that makes a life much better
  :-)

t0:
  Which methods of infections do you prefer, and which techniques do you like 
  more? How you think, what we can expect in the future?

herm1t:
  Classical file viruses are long time dead. And there are a lot of modern 
  malware that exploits two glaring security holes in unix systems (LD_PRELOAD
  and ptrace), though, with ptrace restricted and possibility that LD_PRELOAD 
  will be shut down as well, the old time infection techniques could be re-used
  again, eg by replacing libz.so in sshd by some lib-boring-something or adding
  a snippet to the binary :-) It's a shame that sshd backdors (like in ESET's 
  "Darkside") or something like Darkleech still needs to be recompiled on target
  system. It seems that blackhats has missed their classes and trying to 
  reinvent the wheel.

t0:
  Do you think ELF virus writing has a future ? Are we staying in the past ?

herm1t:
  With Linux in every phone, in IOTs and desktops I am sure that the arts of ELF
  infection and system's internals will be popular again.

t0:
  Have you seen the new CET / -fcf-protection that is implemented on 95% of 
  binaries in Ubuntu 20.04? Do you have thoughts on this, or have you messed 
  around with it yet?

herm1t:
  I am not familiar with CET yet, but there is a story I can tell you. Once I 
  was after some guy and was I lacked (to complete the security check up) was 
  his phone number. I tried to OSINT but to no avail. Then I just mailed him 
  from some phony account and wrote "mail me your phone, ASAP" and what do you
  think? he did. One cannot guarantee security by pure technical means. there 
  will be always a loophole.

t0:
  What do you think about modern malware?

herm1t:
  Most of the time it's extremely boring (but still effective)

t0:
  Do you think the VX scene still has a chance? With everything that happened 
  during more recent times, malware focused on monetization, etc. What happened
  with VXHeavens? Plans for the future? In which ways do you think malware 
  writing has changed since the last decade?

herm1t:
  The scene as we knew it is dead (I discussed it with LovinGod recently and he 
  called VXH a "coffin of a scene"), but there could be a wider community, since
  both virus writing and hacking in general became more actual than ever. Back 
  in 2018 I spotted the webshell (installed by anyone but me) on ministry of 
  justice of ukraine and made some lulz on them on facebook. cyberpolice took it
  seriously and they decided to raid the messenger. i knew about the raid in 
  advance and shout down the site (cause sharing of viruses in Ukraine is 
  illegal in any form), may be I will restore it in some form again. With court
  hearing on "Greta case" four days ahead I find it hard to set a date :-)

  btw, with all these endbr64 stuff in .plt and elsewhere, if you modify the 
  binary it will "protect" your virus from "unauthorized" rets :-)

t0:
  Talk to us about your own linux viruses - Casher, Cavity, Pulpit, other?

herm1t:
  Most of my viruses were focused on tricks with the ELF format, I just opened
  some random executable and looked through the sections with a few questions in
  mind - could it be moved or shrinked to make some space? could you get control
  from it to avoid touching entry point? So the viruses does exactly just that, 
  "Coin" got more space from segment alignment requirements, "Caveat" put loader
  in PHT, "Arches" used functions padding, "Hasher" played with .hash, "PiLoT" 
  with .plt; more recent ones is about stop using assembly, stop DOS-like 
  patterns of using syscalls directly and switch to imports from libc which is 
  always present in memory and go deeper to self-relocation (RELx) and 
  metamorphism (Lacrimae). Since that time I am still interested in glibc/kernel
  internals at it helped me a lot with system programming and security (which I 
  am doing for a living)

t0:
  What do you think about metamorphism in script languages ? I'm thinking about
  "Metamorphism and Self-Compilation in JavaScript" written by SPTH

herm1t:
  Getting back to technical stuff, you probably knew that I am a big fan of 
  compilers related stuff and I am dead sure that stuff like DSL and compilers
  are the next big thing after metamorphism, being it scripts (which is less 
  complicated) or machine code.

t0:
  how did you learn these other skills - the social engineering - does it come 
  naturally to you or did you study psychology, or read about social engineering
  others did?

herm1t:
  Any large bureaucracy has inherent weaknesses, it's the system and it can be 
  hacked, if you knew how legitimate request looks like you could forge it, by 
  using interagency rivalry you could left them no choice but to proceed. Having
  access to hacked mails you can get virtually into the head of the target and 
  manipulate person into doing something you need. I more like the process, that
  very moment when you find your way around the security. But the "message" 
  phase, when you put the dumped info online and tip of the press is the same.
  You need to deliver your message both to the targets to make them sorrow and
  wide audience, to convince people that that was right thing to do, so it a bit
  like hacking but with people instead of machines.

t0:
  What do you think about CTFs and other hacking competitions ?

herm1t:
  I don't like CTFs cause I hate time pressure. I know how to do things quick 
  and stay calm, but it ticks me off when I see clocks ticking.

t0:
  Have you damaged your own system testing a virus? If yes can you talk a bit 
  about the case?

herm1t:
  Since none of my viruses has destructive payloads and usually they were 
  intentionally limited to current directory it was safe to test them. May be
  one or two times they escape but it is easy to reinstall affected packages.

t0:
  What would your dream virii look be like?

herm1t:
  Complexity, irregularity. More complex, more better.

t0:
  What other places outside technology do you look to get inspiration from?

herm1t:
  It's hard for me to find something outside technology, surely I do usual 
  things all the people do, but my favorites are math, cryptography and messing
  in politics.

t0:
  Can you share some thoughts on ransomeware?

herm1t:
  Ransomware is old as our field are. The AIDS trojan was written in 1989! Wide
  use of cryptocurrency and its less traceable nature made the proliferation of
  ransomware inevitable. From technical point of view it's boring (except for 
  hilarious mistakes in cryptography some authors did, like generating the key
  by RNG seeded with time(NULL), and after public humiliation replacing it by 
  something like md5(time(NULL))

t0:
  This is your free space, herm1t. Here you can leave anything you want: greets 
  or wishes for friends or someone else, etc.

herm1t:
  Greetz to all hackers and vxers of past and future :)
