I see a virus named "Nasty", and the song that comes to my mind is the one by Janet 
Jackson.  I'm about 30 years too early.


NASTY LIMITS

The virus begins by opening the current directory, and reading as many entries into memory
as will fit into a 1kb buffer on the stack.  This might be only a few files if the names 
are very long.  The virus exits if an error occurred, otherwise it accepts the returned 
value as the number of bytes that were read...


NASTY BUGS

However, here is the first bug: the virus continues if zero bytes were read.  This is 
interpreted as a buffer of enormous size.  The directory parser will then read 
uninitialised memory freely.  The result is either an infinite loop, if a zero is read 
as the reclen value; or it will crash if a large value is read that causes the pointer 
to reach outside of the buffer.  Of course, the trigger for this bug is a very unlikely 
scenario, and easy to miss.

If the directory was read correctly, then the virus looks for regular file entries.  
If one is found, then the virus tries to open the file for read and write.

Here is the second bug: the buffer pointer is saved on the stack prior to attempting to 
open the file, but it is not removed from the stack if an error occurs.  That leads to 
an unbalanced stack on exit, which will prevent the host program from being able to 
access its command-line parameters and environment.  The bug would not be visible if the 
host program is very simple, which is probably why it was not found.

If the file can be opened for read and write, then the virus copies the filename to a 
buffer on the stack, immediately below the buffer that holds the directory entries.  
Fortunately for the virus author, the maximum length of a filename on Linux filesystems 
is most commonly 255 characters, so there is no risk of overrunning the 400 bytes large 
buffer.

If the virus can create a memory-map of the file, then the virus parses the file contents.
The virus is interested in files that are 64-bit x86 ELF format, and not infected already.
The infection marker is the string "TMZ" in the padding field.  For each file that is 
considered for infection, the virus searches the program header table for a loadable 
segment that is both readable and executable.


EXPRESSION OF INTEREST

For each program header that is not of interest, the virus adjusts the program header 
offset in the file in order to make room for the virus.  After parsing all of the program
header entries, the virus performs the same adjustment to all of the section header 
entries.

If the virus finds a readable and executable program header, then the virus adjusts both 
the address and size in the entry to make room for the virus code.  The assumption is 
that one, and only one, such segment will be found.  This could be considered a bug for 
three reasons.  One bug is that there might not be any executable segments, because the 
file might contain only data.  The second bug is that the segment could also be writable, 
or have other attributes set.  The third bug is that there might be more than one loadable
segment, and the last one will be used, despite adjustments being made to the address and 
size of earlier ones.  These changes alter the file permanently, even if the infection 
process is abandoned later.  This complicates any clean-up effort, since the changes 
cannot be reversed without knowing that the virus has been run against those files.

After parsing the section headers, the virus attempts to create a file named ".nty.tmp" 
in the current directory.  If the file creation fails, then the mapped file is leaked.  
If the file creation succeeds, then the virus moves the location of the program header 
table and section header table up in memory, to make room for the virus code, and sets 
the new entrypoint to point to the original location of the program header table, 
adjusted for the introduced space for the virus code.

The virus writes to the temporary file the new ELF header, then the virus code, and then 
the rest of the original file.  If all goes well, then the virus unmaps the original file,
and moves the ".nty.tmp" file to replace the original file.


STOP.  HAMMER TIME

After all files in the directory buffer are examined, the virus displays its payload

Nasty by TMZ (c) 2021

Nasty, nasty
Triple X rated
Nasty, nasty
Justice, a waste-pit
Nasty, nasty
Deeper in the dirt
Nasty, nasty
Making bodies hurt

These are lyrics from the song "Nasty" by The Prodigy.  Then the virus executes the host 
original entrypoint code.


CONCLUSION

Debugging is the process of removing bugs from code.  Therefore, programming is the process 
of adding bugs to code.  Naming the virus "nasty" is appropriate on several levels.
