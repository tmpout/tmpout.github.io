Concealing Namespaces Within a File Descriptor
~ Fanda Uchytil (h4x.cz)

===[ Abstract ]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this paper, we will delve into several techniques that can help us hide an
entire namespace within a seemingly innocent file descriptor. This can be
particularly useful during the post-exploitation phase when we need a concealed
tunnel.

We will explore some aspects related to namespaces. We will begin by discussing
how the user can interface with namespaces and how they are referenced. We will
then look at the technique of hiding a network namespace within a single socket
and explore how inotify can be used as a path obfuscator. Throughout our
exploration, we will also examine the available detection mechanisms. Finally,
we will demonstrate the practical application of these techniques by creating a
simple kernelspace "reverse-proxy" within a dormant userspace process.




===[ Introduction: What Are Linux Namespaces Anyway? ]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linux namespaces are simple in concept, yet complicated in implementation. It
is apparent that they were added as an afterthought, and that the kernel code
had to be twisted to implement them [ref1]. As the old saying goes:

  "Opportunity makes the hacker."

Namespaces serve as fundamental building blocks for containers [ref2], utilized
by platforms like Docker and LXC. They provide a mechanism to alter a process'
perspective of the system. The true power of namespaces lies in their ability
to function independently.

For instance, if we want to restrict an application's network access to a
specific network, we can easily create a new network namespace, bind a (SOCKS)
socket as the sole interface to the external world, create firewall rules for
redirection, and move the process into the network namespace. In this scenario,
if the (SOCKS) socket stops working, the application will be unable to access
any other network (I highly recommend this approach for enforcing VPN traffic;
see [ref3]).

The main downfall of namespaces or Linux in general is their limited
observability. And I'm not talking about tracing, which is nearly perfect. What
I am referring to is making a good assessment about the state of the running
system, especially for those who are not kernel developers.

In this article, we will primarily focus on the network namespace due to its
highly practical applications.




===[ Interacting with Namespaces ]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a crash course on working with namespaces from userspace [ref2]:

  - A new namespace can be created using two syscalls: ''clone(2)'' or
    ''unshare(2)''.

  - A process can switch to another namespace using the ''setns(2)'' syscall.

  - Various information about a namespace can be obtained using the classic
    ''ioctl(2)'' syscall.

  - A namespace can be referenced through the ''nsfs'' pseudo file system
    located at ''/proc/PID/ns''.

Don't worry, we will make use of them later on.




===[ Death by Lack of Reference: How Namespaces Die? ]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The lifetime of a namespace mostly depends on the last standing process that is
referencing it. In most cases, when the referencing process terminates, any
namespaces without any reference are automatically removed.

(There seem to be some exceptions, for instance bind mount: it just moves the
reference to another process's mount namespace, so if that process also
terminates, the namespace will be removed).

Each namespace has its own reference counter(s). When a new namespace is
created, the counter is set to 1, because the process calling the syscall is
referencing it. Whenever the namespace is referenced, such as when creating a
listening TCP socket, the counter is incremented. When the counter reaches
zero, the namespace is cleaned up and removed.

For example, the initialization of a network namespace [ref4] looks as follows:

  /* setup_net runs the initializers for the network namespace object.
   */
  static int setup_net(struct net *net, struct user_namespace *user_ns)
  {
      ...
      refcount_set(&net-&gt;count, 1);     /* To decide when the network namespace
                                           should be freed. */
      refcount_set(&net-&gt;passive, 1);   /* To decide when the network namespace
                                           should be shut down. */

(Btw, ''net-&gt;passive'' holds the reference to the network namespace, ensuring
that it is not freed. However, it does not prevent network interfaces from
being removed, which is not the desired outcome. To increase the counter
''net-&gt;passive'' for the current network namespace, one approach is to mount
sysfs within the namespace).

The increment and decrement operations are primarily performed by these inline
functions [ref5]:

  static inline struct net *get_net(struct net *net)
  {
      refcount_inc(&net-&gt;count);
      return net;
  }

  static inline void put_net(struct net *net)
  {
      if (refcount_dec_and_test(&net-&gt;count))
          __put_net(net);
  }

The ''net-&gt;count'' is incremented, for example, when a socket is created
(allocated/cloned), when an ''nsfs'' file descriptor is opened, or bind-
mounted. Other interesting places include netlink operations and network
modules such as NFS, CIFS, Ceph, ...




===[ Hiding a Network Namespace within a Socket ]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sockets have three intriguing aspects:

  1. They are (more or less) associated with a network namespace.

  2. They are a commonly used functionality. (No suspicion there, right?)

  3. We can retrieve the network namespace associated with them.

When we create a socket file descriptor, it increments the reference counter
for the current network namespace [ref6]. Keeping this in mind, let's explore
what happens when we create a new network namespace, create a socket there, and
then switch back to the original network namespace. If our hypothesis is
correct, the file descriptor should be able to hold the new network namespace
even if it is the only file descriptor referencing it.

Remember, we must abide by the hacker's oath -- PoC || GTFO:

---------------------------{ socket_ns_reference.c }---------------------------
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;sched.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

#define pw(s)  printf (s); getc (stdin)

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int fd_socket;
    int fd_netns_orig;

    fd_netns_orig = open ("/proc/self/ns/net", O_RDONLY);

    pw ("@ ORIGINAL NET NS...");

    unshare (CLONE_NEWNET);
    fd_socket = socket (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

    pw ("@ NEW NET NS + NEW SOCKET...");

    setns (fd_netns_orig, CLONE_NEWNET);
    close (fd_netns_orig);

    pw ("@ ORIGINAL NET NS + EXISTING SOCKET...");

    close (fd_socket);

    pw ("@ ORIGINAL NET NS + CLOSED SOCKET...");

    return 0;
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To summarize what we did:

  1. We opened ''/proc/self/ns/net'' to create a reference to our current
     network namespace. (We need it to switch back to it).

  2. Using the ''unshare(2)'' syscall, we created a new network namespace and
     switched our process to it.

  3. In the new network namespace, we created a socket.

  4. We then switched back to the original network namespace.

  5. At this point, the only reference to the new network namespace is the
     socket ''fd_socket''.

  6. When we close the socket, the new network namespace ceases to exist.

Neato! We are effectively holding the entire network namespace with just one
socket. Let's take it a step further and create something more practical. We
will create a fully functional network similar to what you would find in a
container. In the following example, we will utilize the highly useful tool
from the ''iproute2'' package to help us in setting up the network.

----------------------------{ socket_container.c }-----------------------------
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;sched.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

#define pw(s)  printf (s); getc (stdin)

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int fd_netns_orig, fd_netns_new;
    char str[512];

    /* Keep the reference to the host NET NS. */
    fd_netns_orig = open ("/proc/self/ns/net", O_RDONLY);

    /* Create a new network "container" */
    unshare (CLONE_NEWNET);
    socket (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    fd_netns_new = open ("/proc/self/ns/net", O_RDONLY);

    /* Create a macvlan interface and move it to our "container" */
    setns (fd_netns_orig, CLONE_NEWNET);
    system ("ip link add mvlan0 link eth0 type macvlan mode private");
    snprintf (str, sizeof (str), "ip link set mvlan0 netns /proc/self/fd/%d",
              fd_netns_new);
    system (str);

    /* Setup the network inside our "container" */
    setns (fd_netns_new, CLONE_NEWNET);
    system ("ip link set up lo");
    system ("ip link set up mvlan0");
    system ("ip addr add 172.19.1.222/24 dev mvlan0");
    system ("ip route add default via 172.19.1.1");

    // pw ("nsenter me, then hit &lt;ENTER&gt; to continue...");

    /* Close all references to the new NET NS but the socket  */
    setns (fd_netns_orig, CLONE_NEWNET);
    close (fd_netns_orig);
    close (fd_netns_new);
    pw ("Hit &lt;ENTER&gt; to exit...");

    return 0;
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we run the program above, we should be able to ping the ''172.19.1.222''
address. BUT, NOT FROM THE HOST! BECAUSE THE MACVLAN INTERFACE WAS CREATED AS
''private''! (This behavior might be surprising, especially if you are
encountering the macvlan interface for the first time -- refer to the diagrams
in [ref7] to gain some intuition).

NOTE: When debugging, I highly recommend replacing macvlan with a veth-pair,
uncommenting the ''pw ("nsenter...")'' line, and entering the namespace using a
command like ''nsenter -n -t "$(pidof socket_container)"'', and testing the
network from there.

We have a fully functional network hidden within a socket. How awesome is
that?! Before we move on to another technique, let's briefly discuss the topic
of detection.




===[ Detecting a Network Namespace within a Socket ]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we inspect the running program, it appears innocent enough. The network
namespace is the same as init's network namespace:

  # ls -l /proc/"$(pidof socket_container)"/ns/net /proc/1/ns/net

  lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   /proc/1/ns/net      -&gt; 'net:[4026531992]'
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   /proc/194687/ns/net -&gt; 'net:[4026531992]'

The only open file descriptors are stdin, stdout, stderr, and a
totally-non-suspicious TCP socket:

  # ls -l /proc/"$(pidof socket_container)"/fd/

  lrwx------ 1 root root   0 -&gt; /dev/pts/12
  lrwx------ 1 root root   1 -&gt; /dev/pts/12
  lrwx------ 1 root root   2 -&gt; /dev/pts/12
  lrwx------ 1 root root   4 -&gt; 'socket:[1149645]'

The socket does not carry any special information, and the information we can
gather through regular means is limited:

  # cat /proc/"$(pidof socket_container)"/fdinfo/4

  pos:    0
  flags:  02
  mnt_id: 9


  # getfattr -d -m system.sockprotoname -e text --absolute-names \
      /proc/"$(pidof socket_container)"/fd/4

  system.sockprotoname="TCP"

From the ''flags'', we can determine that the socket is ''O_RDWR'' [ref8], this
is not helpful at all. If we try to find the ''mnt_id'' (mount identifier), for
example, using the command ''grep '^9 ' /proc/*/mountinfo'', we will not find a
match. Okay, on its own, this information can be helpful in some situations as
we can deduce that it might be a hidden kernel file system. But not here, as it
is the ''sockfs'' pseudo file system, which is used for all sockets. So, there
is no surprise here either.

If we call the ''getxattr(2)'' syscall (or use the ''getfattr'' command) on
the ''/proc/PID/fd/SOCK_FD'' [ref9], we can retrieve that it is a TCP socket,
which provides us with slightly more information than before, but it is still
not particularly useful. Furthermore, if we attempt to search for the socket
inode across all available network information in all visible network
namespaces, for example, by running the command ''grep -r 1149645
/proc/[0-9]*/net'', we will not find any matches. Of course, this should raise
a red flag, as on a normally behaving system, we should be able to observe all
network stacks.

Although the socket cannot be found in the ''/proc'' directory, it can still be
detected using ''tcpdump'' when there is active traffic. For example, by
running ''tcpdump'' directly on the backend interface for the macvlan (e.g.,
''eth0''), we can observe packets that originate from or are directed towards
our network namespace. Unfortunately, we cannot pinpoint the specific process,
especially if the process itself is not generating any traffic! (We will create
a scenario demonstrating such behavior later on).



===[ Hiding a Namespace with an Inotify Watch ]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A socket can still draw attention as it indicates network communication.
Ultimately, all we want is a reference to our network namespaces with minimal
information about the original file descriptor. Is that too much to ask for?
Maybe not. In fact, there is a slick way to hold such a reference using
''inotify(7)''.

Inotify provides a mechanism for monitoring file system events on a specified
path [ref10]. It works by opening a file path and returning a special inotify
file descriptor known as a watch descriptor. We can use this watch descriptor
to listen for events (e.g., using the ''select(2)'' syscall).

Once an inotify watch is initialized, it finds the inode number for the file
path being watched. However, after initialization, the path name itself becomes
unnecessary, and subsequent operations are performed on the inode. As a result,
the path name is lost in the process [ref11].

While it is generally possible to correlate the inode number obtained from the
watch descriptor (found in ''/proc/PID/fdinfo/FD'') with the inode numbers of
files in file systems, it is not applicable in our case. This is because both
''sockfs'' and ''nsfs'' are in-kernel pseudo file systems that cannot be
accessed directly.

This is great news for us, as we can utilize the ''inotify_add_watch(2)''
syscall as an obfuscator. We will provide the ''/proc/PID/fd/FD'' file path to
it, which will create a reference to the ''FD'' file descriptor, and when we
subsequently close the original file descriptor ''FD'', the association with
the file path will be lost, but the file descriptor will still retain its
reference.

That sounds arousing, but can we actually use it? Let's refer to the
''inotify(7)'' man page [ref10]:

  Furthermore, various pseudo-filesystems such as /proc, /sys, and /dev/pts are
  not monitorable with inotify.

While man pages are indeed a great source of information, they can sometimes be
misleading. "Not being monitorable" does not imply failure. The following
experiment demonstrates that an inotify watch can create a reference to a
''nsfs'' pseudo file (the same applies to ''sockfs'') and that it is capable of
holding a (network) namespace:

-------------------------{ inotify_nsfs_reference.c }--------------------------
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sched.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/inotify.h&gt;

#define pw(s)  printf (s); getc (stdin)

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int fd_ino        = inotify_init1 (IN_NONBLOCK);;
    int fd_netns_orig = open ("/proc/self/ns/net", O_RDONLY);

    /* Create a new NET NS and switch to it.
     */
    unshare (CLONE_NEWNET);

    /* Create an inotify watch descriptor to the new NET NS. It will increment
     * the reference counter in the kernel, and it will keep the new NET NS
     * active even after we switch to another NET NS.
     */
    inotify_add_watch (fd_ino, "/proc/self/ns/net", IN_MODIFY);

    /* Switch to the original NET NS (and decrement the reference counter to it
     * in the kernel).
     */
    setns (fd_netns_orig, CLONE_NEWNET);

    close (fd_netns_orig);

    pw ("@ ORIGINAL NS + INOTIFY REFERENCE. Hit &lt;ENTER&gt; to continue...");

    /* Now, the only reference to the new NET NS is held by the inotify watch
     * descriptor.
     *
     * When the inotify watch is closed, the new NET NS is freed.
     */
    close (fd_ino);

    /* The new NET NS is removed. */

    return 0;
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amazing! This technique not only increases the reference counter for the
specific namespace or file descriptor but also effectively hides the reference
itself.

However, there is one hint that can reveal the ''nsfs'': the device number
''sdev''. When we encounter something like ''sdev:4'', it indicates that the
device number is ''0:4'' (major:minor) [ref12], and if we cannot find it in the
''/proc/PID/mountinfo'' file [ref13], it stinks with an in-kernel pseudo file
system. We can easily verify this by bind mounting some ''nsfs'' namespace
symlink:

  # touch /tmp/test
  # mount -o bind /proc/1/ns/net /tmp/test
  # grep /tmp/test /proc/1/mountinfo

  166 26 0:4 net:[4026531992] /tmp/test rw shared:92 - nsfs nsfs rw
         ^^^

A similar approach can be applied to a socket, although not through
bind-mounting since ''sockfs'' is not mountable in userspace [ref14]. However,
we can still utilize the technique described earlier by using inotify on
different types of pseudo file systems and checking their ''sdev'' vaule.




===[ Battle of the Techniques: Socket vs Inotify ]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inotify seems like a superior option due to the difficulty of discovering the
original file descriptor. However, a socket has a valuable property: we can
retrieve its network namespace. Imagine a scenario where we create a backdoor
program that hides a malicious network namespace within a socket most of the
time. When needed, such as for network or firewall reconfiguration, the program
can retrieve the network namespace using a simple ''ioctl()'' call:

-------------------------{ retrieve_ns_from_socket.c }-------------------------
int fd_socket, fd_netns_orig;

/* Create a socket in the current (original) NET NS. */
fd_socket = socket (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

/* Create a new NET NS and switch to it. */
unshare (CLONE_NEWNET);

/* Get the (original) NET NS from the socket. */
fd_netns_orig = ioctl (fd_socket, SIOCGSKNS);

/* Switch to the (original) NET NS. */
setns (fd_netns_orig, CLONE_NEWNET);

/* Close the open fd reference to the (original) NET NS, so it cannot be easily
 * seen in the /proc/PID/fd/FD.
 */
close (fd_netns_orig);

/* ... Do stuff and switch back to another NET NS ... */
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the other hand, this capability can also be used to our disadvantage. When
some aggressor connects to our innocent backdoor process, steals the socket
file descriptor, and uses the ''ioctl(2)'' call described above, they can
potentially perform unholy forensics on it.

(Btw, I highly doubt that someone would go to such lengths. It would be more
practical for an investigator to create a kernel module that exports the
''nsfs'' of all namespaces).




===[ Honorable mention: Referring to a Namespace via Bind-Mount ]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At first glance, there is a cool way to hold a namespace. Namely, files from
the ''nsfs'' pseudo file system can be bind-mounted. (This technique is
utilized by ''iproute2'' for the ''ip netns add'' command [ref15]). The
''mount(2)'' call for this operation would look as follows:

  mount("/proc/self/ns/net", "/run/netns/test_netns", "none", MS_BIND, NULL)

This approach is kinda elegant, but unfortunately, it is quite easy to find
because it has a distinct file system type called ''nsfs'':

  # grep nsfs /proc/self/mountinfo

  166 159 0:4 net:[4026532193] /run/netns/test_netns rw shared:92 - nsfs nsfs rw
  167 25 0:4 net:[4026532193] /run/netns/test_netns rw shared:92 - nsfs nsfs rw

If we were looking to identify such a bind-mount, we could simply search
through every process and its corresponding ''/proc/self/mountinfo'' file for
the presence of ''nsfs'':

  find /proc -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -name 'mountinfo' -exec grep netns '{}' +

Dealing with bind-mounted ''nsfs'' is relatively straightforward process. We
first switch to the mount namespace and then, from there, switch to the
bind-mounted network namespace, giving us full access to the network.

While we are at it, let's again look at some detection methodologies.




===[ Peering into the Abyss: Userspace Information About Namespaces ]~~~~~~~~~~

In general, Linux does not provide a lot of information about the kernelspace,
and the available information about namespaces is no exception. Simply scanning
the ''/proc/'' and ''/sys/'' directories is not sufficient, the information
provided by syscalls is sparse, and processing ''/proc/kcore'' is challenging
due to the complexity and evolving structure of kernel structures.

(Personally, I would appreciate having a ''/proc/'' directory that provides an
''nsfs'' entry with all active namespaces on the system. I understand that
implementing such a feature would be hard as it could potentially compromise
the security of the whole system. However, having this functionality would
greatly simplify auditing the system).

Active logging is a viable option. Linux offers powerful instrumentation
capabilities, such as kprobes [ref16], which can be used to log the creation
and cleanup of namespaces on the system. This logging mechanism can help
identify active namespaces and determine their original parent processes.

However, it is important to note that when a process forks, its child inherits
all the namespaces from its parent. The same can be true for ''execve(2)'' when
file descriptors have not been set with the ''O_CLOEXEC'' flag. Additionally,
if the parent process dies, we may quickly lose the connection between PIDs
and the associated namespaces. This can make analysis more difficult in a
dynamic environment such as Docker or LXC.

Regardless, let's explore some options that are available to us:


1. The PID actively using a namespace can be found by dereferencing the
''/proc/PID/ns/*'' path:

  # find /proc/ -maxdepth 3 -mindepth 3 ! -type d \
      \( -path '/proc/[0-9]*/ns/net' \) -printf '%l\n' | sort | uniq -c

      108 net:[4026531992]
        1 net:[4026532193]


2. The opened file descriptor of the namespace can be obtained by accessing the
''/proc/PID/fd/*'' path:

  # find /proc/ -maxdepth 3 -mindepth 3 ! -type d \
      \( -path '/proc/[0-9]*/fd/*' \) -printf '%l\n' | grep ^net: | sort \
      | uniq -c

  1 net:[4026532193]


3. The ''nsfs'' bind-mount can be found by inspecting the
''/proc/PID/mountinfo'' files:

  # find /proc -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -name 'mountinfo' \
      -exec grep -h netns '{}' + | sort | uniq -c

  101 159 25  0:22 /netns /run/netns ... shared:5           - tmpfs ...
    1 161 242 0:22 /netns /run/netns ... shared:89 master:5 - tmpfs ...
    1 163 113 0:22 /netns /run/netns ... shared:90 master:5 - tmpfs ...
    1 165 66  0:22 /netns /run/netns ... shared:91 master:5 - tmpfs ...


4. The ''tcpdump'' tool on the host can capture and view all traffic on the
interface (even when using macvlan in private mode within our network
namespace). Moreover, with eBPF, we may have the capability to trace the exact
source of the traffic.


5. Monitoring kernel functions with kprobes (e.g., using eBPF, perf, ftrace) is
a viable approach, although it does have some flaws. One of the main challenges
is that certain functions are inlined and cannot be directly instrumented (for
instance, initialization and cleanup of the UTS namespace [ref17]). However,
there are still several functions that are suitable and can be effectively
instrumented.

To identify the relevant function, use ''ftrace'' (see, for example, [ref18]).
Look for keywords like ''ns'' and the name of the specific namespace, such as
''uts''. (In this article I was heavily instrumenting ''net_drop_ns'',
''__put_net'', ''cleanup_net'' and ''put_mnt_ns'' functions).


6. Extracting data from the relevant structures within the ''/proc/kcore''
pseudo-file can be an excellent source of truth (unless the system is
compromised ;)). However, one significant drawback is the requirement for
extensive knowledge about the structures specific to the current kernel
version. Generally, obtaining a comprehensive understanding from
''/proc/kcore'' is achievable, but it poses significant challenges.

For example, in the 5.10 kernel version, a new network namespace is added
[ref19] to the end of the linked list within the ''struct net''. This means that
we can view all existing network namespaces by using the following ''drgn''
[ref20] script:

-----------------------------{ get_all_net_ns.py }-----------------------------
#!/usr/bin/python3

import drgn
from drgn.helpers.linux.list import *

prog = drgn.program_from_kernel ()
init_nsproxy = prog['init_nsproxy']

print ("initial net ns inode =",  init_nsproxy.net_ns.ns.inum)

for i in list_for_each_entry ('struct net', init_nsproxy.net_ns.list.address_of_(), 'list'):
    print ("net ns inode =", i.ns.inum)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What we are essentially doing here is obtaining a pointer to the initial
network namespace from the ''init_nsproxy'' global variable [ref21]. Using this
pointer, we can iterate through the link list [ref22] that holds references to
the other network namespaces.

By performing this traversal, we gain the ability to see the existing network
namespaces in the system.


Logging and observing can provide invaluable insights into the current
behavior, however they do not offer a direct solution for switching into or
terminating the hidden namespace and disarm them. Moreover, we can make it even
more complicated...




===[ Side quest: Process Resiliency ]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the biggest flaws with the namespace hiding so far is its dependency on
the existence of the process. And I don't know if you know this, but userspace
processes can be killed! I know, I know, it's quite a shocking revelation.
Anyway, this poses a significant challenge when relying on processes. Just a
single well-aimed ''SIGKILL'' signal, and our carefully crafted backdoor can be
swiftly eliminated.

Making a process unkillable is indeed an interesting topic on its own. We can
make our process somewhat resilient to killing by utilizing signal filtering
with tools like AppArmor or SElinux (see [ref23] for more details).

Additionally, we should not forget to forbid ptrace attach with the classic
''ptrace (PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, 0, 0)'' and ideally on a system-wide level with
Yama (see [ref24]).

If possible, let the kernel handle all the operations you need, as it offers
various offloading capabilities (we will explore an example in the following
section). Moreover, kernel workers operate independently of userspace
processes, meaning that a functional userspace process is not necessary for the
kernel to function properly. So, in the event that an uninterpretable D is
inadvertently created within our process, the process itself may be lost
indefinitely, but the kernel functionalities referenced by the process will
remain available and functional.

These measures can provide an extra layer of protection and make it more
challenging for an "attacker" to kill our process.




===[ Good Luck, I'm Behind 7 Proxies ]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the notable advantages of network namespaces is that they provide a
complete implementation of a network stack, allowing us to configure the
netfilter firewall according to our specific needs. This is particularly
significant because netfilter rules are primarily processed in the kernelspace,
eliminating the requirement for a functional userspace process. Consequently,
we can define firewall rules directly within the kernel, controlling network
traffic without relying on userspace process.

For example, we can create a simple iptables travel agency:

---------------------{ iptables within socket_container }----------------------
iptables --table nat --insert PREROUTING --protocol tcp --dport 1337 \
    --jump DNAT --to-destination 1.1.1.1:443
iptables --insert FORWARD --jump ACCEPT
iptables --table nat --insert POSTROUTING --jump MASQUERADE
sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we apply these rules in our ''socket_container'', it can be utilized as a
jump host. For instance, when we go to ''172.19.1.222:1337'', our traffic will
be transparently redirected to ''1.1.1.1:443''. This can be easily tested using
the ''curl'' command:

  curl -k -H "Host: 1.1.1.1" https://172.19.1.222:1337/

These rules can be chained across multiple hosts, with the last host serving as
a SOCKS proxy (see [ref3]). It would be unstable as heck, but then we will be
behind 7 proxies and that counts for something!




===[ Conclusion ]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have learned a very sophisticated and big brain technique that enables us to
hide references to any namespace using inotify. One notable advantage of this
approach is its integration within the main functionality of the system,
eliminating the need for potentially restricted kernel modules, especially in
situations where the kernel is signed.

However, we have barely touched upon the possibilities and applications of this
method. One simple and useful application is a netfilter tunnel, but the
potential extends much further. For instance, there are other network
interfaces such as ipvlan or macvtap that can be valuable in certain scenarios.
Proxy ARP is another interesting concept to explore. Additionally, while we
mainly focused on network namespaces, user namespaces can also bring some joy,
as they have very interesting relationships with other namespaces.

To sum up this article, I would like to cite the bestest hacking movie of all
time [ref25]:

  To be elite, you have to do a righteous hack, not this accidental shit.

Oh, wait...
