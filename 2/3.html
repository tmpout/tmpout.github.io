File parsers are a core component of any complex computer system. Knowing what data to 
load and how to interpret it are key features of any good file parser. To speed up or 
simplify the parsing process, assumptions about the nature of the file are typically made.
These assumptions can create conditions that allow for anything from evading analysis, to 
crashing the parser, to executing code.

This paper will cover some ELF parser bugs that I found when I was doing research for
ELF Binary Mangling Part 4.

[ 1.0 Endianness Assumptions ]────────────────────────────────────────────────────────//──

This bug affects a whole lot of parser libraries. I originally noticed it a few years back
when I started putting code in ei_data inside the ELF header and realizing just how bad it
messed various tools up.

This is an example of an unpacked, unstripped, Mirai binary targeting MIPS.

In an ELF file, the endianness is set by the ELF header field ei_data. In a big endian
MIPS binary, ei_data = 2. For all little endian binaries, ei_data = 1.

The first part of our binary's header looks like this:

  ELFHEADER A───────┐ B┐C┐ D┐E┐ F─────────────────┐
  00000000: 7f45 4c46 0102 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000  .ELF............

This field is important, because structures in the ELF header are stored based on 
the target machine's endianness. 

By setting ei_data to 1, the analysis breaks.

This also happens if ei_data is 0. This is due to the endianness assumption that many 
tools make by default. Assuming that data is little endian unless explicitly specified
can lead to misparsing issues that will cascade across a complex analysis stack. We'll
see why this is important later on in this paper.

The e_machine field is processed as 0x800. This is because the e_machine number for MIPS 
is 8, but the byte order is wrong. In the binutils source, it also states that this field
is officially for "big-endian only".

https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb/blob/master/include/elf/common.h#L115

  #define EM_MIPS     8 /* MIPS R3000 (officially, big-endian only) */

:: 1.1 Ghidra, Ida, GDB, binutils Anti-Debug :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

To demonstrate how widespread this sort of issue is, let's take a look at some other tools
commonly used to debug and analyze ELF files.

When ei_data is changed to 1 in le.Eros.mips, Ghidra will recognize it as an ELF, but it
won't know what language (cpu arch) it is. This was tested on ghidra_10.1.1_PUBLIC.

The unmodified MIPS ELF is parsed properly and is recognized as a MIPS ELF:

<img src="./img/ghidra.mips.be.png">

The MIPS ELF with ei_data set to 1 looks like this:

<img src="./img/ghidra.mips.le.png">

Additionally, when testing my PoC from EBM4 "0xFFtactics" with Ghidra, it doesn't even see
the file as ELF, despite it running just fine on my machine. 

<img src="./img/ghidra.0xfftactics.png">

The file itself has 0xFF for ei_data, with many other fields maxed out in terms of values.
It doesn't contain any overlays, it's just a regular ELF.

  ▶ ./0xFFtactics 
  ▶ echo $?
  6

objdump also has problems with this binary:

  ▶ objdump -d 0xFFtactics
  objdump: 0xFFtactics: file format not recognized

As does GDB:

  ▶ gdb ./0xFFtactics 
  ...snip...
  "/home/user/./0xFFtactics": not in executable format: file format not recognized

As for Ida Pro, similar behavior between the two MIPS ELFs is also achieved. Ida will
see le.Eros.mips as an ELF, but it won't know what CPU architecure to process it as.
These tests were done on Ida Pro 7.6.210427

Here is the unmodified MIPS ELF:

<img src="./img/ida.mips.be.png">

Here is le.Eros.mips. Note that the CPU is listed as "2048", which corresponds to the
e_machine field being swapped to 0x800 when read in little endian format.

<img src="./img/ida.mips.le.png">

With 0xFFtactics, it also doesn't know what architecture it is, but does successfully
characterize it as an ELF.

<img src="./img/ida.0xfftactics.png">

:: 1.2 Breaking Virus Total And Bypassing Heuristic Analysis :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A Virus Total scan on the unmodified binary has 32 detections for Mirai. The same ELF with
ei_data set to 1 has only 8 detections. By flipping just 1 bit in the ELF header, we can
reduce detections by 75%. This has otherwise nothing that would inhibit heuristic analysis
for known Mirai signatures, so a reduction of detections is pretty significant given how
well documented these binaries are.

This same thing happens with x86-64 ELFs. It's arguably more noticeable for an analyst to
see something marked as big endian when most binaries they come across are little endian, 
but it's still something to be aware of. A lot of malware analysis is done by advanced 
tooling that rely on parsers containing these bugs under the hood.

Let's compile a simple program to demonstrate.

  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  void main() { printf("lol\n"); }

If we run the first binary and examine with readelf, we can see it's a normal ELF, that 
executes as expected.

  [user@localhost]-[08:31:53]-[~]
  $ ./endiantest
  lol
  [user@localhost]-[08:32:01]-[~]
  $ readelf -h endiantest

    Entry point address:               0x530
    Start of program headers:          64 (bytes into file)
    Start of section headers:          6440 (bytes into file)
    Flags:                             0x0
    Size of this header:               64 (bytes)
    Size of program headers:           56 (bytes)

    Size of section headers:           64 (bytes)
    Number of section headers:         29
    Section header string table index: 28

If we change the ei_data field to 2, explicitly stating that it's big endian, the 
analysis fails, despite the program executing as expected.

[ SPOOKY TIP ]

Parsers should check e_machine without trying to guess the endianness first, and then 
compare to a list of known machine values, presented in the order that they would appear
in a binary. If an inconsistency is detected, that should be reported by the analysis 
tool. Since the kernel doesn't usually care about ei_data, analysis tools probably 
shouldn't either.

:: 2.1 Linux Kernel - SIGBUS via p_offset ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This bug is triggered simply by making p_offset in a program header larger than the file 
itself. This happens because the ELF parser in the Linux kernel assumes that the Program 
Header is being truthful when it asks where to load and store a certain section of the 
binary into memory.

:: 2.2 rizin - 0xacabacabacabacab Memory Corruption ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

I found this bug via fuzzing. I used honggfuzz and a copy of /bin/true to test rz-bin, 
the file analysis tool in rizin. true is a solid addition to your ELF corpus, because it's
very small, but has all the bells and whistles that you might want to test in an ELF file.

The POC contains the pattern 0xacabacabacabacab at 0x9248 within the section headers which
is free'd by vector_free_elems. It is now in the rizin test-bins repo here:

[ How does this happen? ]

When Rizin sets up a binary for analysis, it creates an object with pieces of info about
the binary. This structure is populated while parsing the file, with sections and their
associated data grouped together in a large vector.

The parser iterates over the ELF header to find where Program and Section Headers are, 
and then iterates over those to process other parts of the file. Because a file would 
never lie, most parsers will take these offsets stored in the headers and process them
as the data they expect. There are often checks for whether or not values exist, but not
necessarily whether they are within a reasonable range.

This is the basic run down for what triggers this bug:

  1.0: rz_bin_elf_init takes the ELFOBJ which represents the file itself in memory.
  1.1: Checks for whether or not it has the headers it expects.
  1.2: Creates a vector to hold all of the binary's sections
  2.0: Call to rz_bin_elf_init_shdr to initialize the section headers vector.
  3.0: Call to rz_bin_elf_convert_sections, which creates another vector by iterating
       over section headers.
  4.0: It succeeds, and follows up with a check for other segments via 
       rz_bin_elf_has_segments, which then calls get_sections_from_dt_dynamic.
  5.0: get_sections_from_dt_dynamic calls a few functions to check what can be done with
       the given section.
  5.1: After all of those checks fail, creates another rz_vector, and attempts to do a 
       final call to the last possible check: create_section_plt.
  6.0: This invokes create_section_from_phdr, which pushes a new element onto the 
       existing vector, and starts adding information to it.
  6.1: This fails, because of the check to section-&gt;offset, which is already now out of
       the bounds of the file. section-&gt;offset is set before this check occurs.
  7.0: All of this causes check in 5.1 to fail, which results in a call to rz_vector_free.
  8.0: This iterates over the vector elements (including the bogus section-&gt;offset), and
       frees them for the length of the vector.
  9.0: The section-&gt;offset pointer is our arbitrary pointer value.

The pointer calculations get messed up due to a few factors here. 

In normal circumstances, the section header offset points to a table of section headers, 
and the parser iterates over them to understand what sections exist in the binary.

The original binary's section header offset was 0x71B8, with 0x1C section headers that 
are 0x40 in length.

  0x1C x 0x40 = 0x700

This makes sense because the file ends at 0x78B8, which means that the original file has 
the sections that run from 0x71B8 to the end of the file

Our evil file ends at 0x994C, but has a section header offset of 0x91D8, with 0x1E 
section headers.

  0x1E x 0x40 = 0x780

  Program Header Ending Address: 0x91D8 + 0x780 = 0x9958

The pointer to the section header buffer is now past the end of the file in memory. This 
leads to both out of bounds reads and writes, and a corrupted pointer within the parser.

There are two takeaways here:

1. Make sure you check that the total number of iterable items and their sizes match the
   true size of the buffer.
2. Don't allocate vectors in memory without verifying that they will actually be filled.

See this link for what the vulnerable function looked like prior to the fix:

[ 3.0 Misparsing Magic Numbers ]──────────────────────────────────────────────────────//──

This isn't an ELF parser bug per se, but a general problem with file parsing as a whole. 
Our binary analysis tools and debuggers usually support more than one binary file type.
Even within families of file types, parsing them correctly can be tricky (as seen above),
so getting the type correct is crucial.

:: 3.1 radare2 5.3.1: CVE-2021-3673 A.K.A. The "LELF" Bug ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This bug was also found via fuzzing. I was working on fuzzing the ELF header, checking 
for things that might throw off a file analysis tool (like the endianness bug) while still
being able to execute properly.

After doing crash analysis, it was apparent that this particular bug could be triggered 
by simply changing the first byte of any ELF binary to an "L". In radare2, this invokes
the Linear Executable parser. 

Linear Executables are an early flavor of EXE file, mainly used for VxD drivers for 
Windows (2.0 - 9x). It's related to PE, with a DOS stub and pointer to the LE header. 
Because the LE signature is known, it's included in how radare2 scans for file types 
within the header when trying to determine the file type. Unfortunately, the binary parser
sets up a binary object for the LE header, without it actually being in the right place.

It prematurely parses the executable with whatever values were already initialized, and 
begins iterating over the header thinking that the rest of the setup code was taken care
of. In the __get_entries function, it starts this process, eventually running into a 
pointer to somewhere that doesn't have anything allocated, and ends up looping over what
it thinks are headers, but the header counter is corrupted as well. This slowly consumes
all system memory resulting in a DOS.

:: 3.2 radare2 4.2.1: LELF Memory Corruption :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

I was testing the LELF bug in earlier versions of radare2 to see if it had a different
effect on those parsers. The version that currently ships in the Ubuntu 20.04 repos is
version 4.2.1, so that's what I used.

When I ran the binary, I noticed that in my POC where I marked the header in ei_padding 
with the string "netspooky", the behavior was different. This actually caused a crash, 
rather than a DOS. The address it crashed on was just beyond the heap.

I saw that it segfaults when dereferencing a value in rax, after doing some pointer math.

   0x7ffff7479126                  mov    rcx, QWORD PTR [r12+0x40]
   0x7ffff747912b                  lea    rax, [rax+rax*2]
   0x7ffff747912f                  lea    rax, [rcx+rax*8]
 → 0x7ffff7479133                  mov    esi, DWORD PTR [rax-0x14]
   0x7ffff7479136                  movzx  eax, WORD PTR [rsp+0x22]
   0x7ffff747913b                  add    rsi, rax
   0x7ffff747913e                  test   r15b, r15b
   0x7ffff7479141                  js     0x7ffff74791d1
   0x7ffff7479147                  mov    rdi, r13

The memory map for the rabin2 binary looked like this:

  gef➤  vmmap
  [ Legend:  Code | Heap | Stack ]
  Start              End                Offset             Perm Path

  0x0000555555559000 0x00005555556ec000 0x0000000000000000 rw- [heap]

The value in RAX was 0x5555557801d8, which is outside of the heap in some unallocated
area. After playing around with "netspooky" string in the header, I realized that
different values resulted in different addresses. My testing showed that the values 
of ei_version and ei_osabi in the ELF header influence the pointer value that is 
initialized and passed into RSI in the address that the segfault occurred on, and
later in the code, it's scaled with RAX.

ei_osabi scales the pointer by 0x1800, and ei_version scales it by 0x18. This is 
then added to another value and used as a base pointer to where the data is located.

I started looking at the LE parser code a bit more indepth than when I initially found 
the LELF bug. This led me back to the __get_entries function in libr/bin/format/le.c. 
It initializes a list to contain headers, and in a while loop, sets up and iterates
over the header. The code then does another loop to initialize all of the headers while 
decrementing the header count value. This is the core functionality of the DOS, but in
this version, the pointer to where the data starts can be reliably controlled. This 
address is passed around in numerous parts of this code.

  /libr/bin/format/le/le.c#L104

This particular bug was actually fixed the same day as the release of 4.2.1, but it's 
still present in the binary that was published, which is still the current version of 
radare2 in Ubuntu 20.04.

[ 4.0 The Forever Haunted ld.so ]─────────────────────────────────────────────────────//──

Now it's time for the skateboarding dog segment. Here are a couple of random bugs related 
to ld.so that are kind of funny.

:: 4.1 Crash Via Static ELF and RWX Page :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

I had been testing some of the parsers with golf'd ELFs, and found that ld will segfault 
when trying to load a small, static ELF.

  user@computer:~/elf$ ./test.bin
  user@computer:~/elf$ echo $?

  section header
  user@computer:~/elf$ ls -la test.bin
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 user user 128 Feb 30 17:49 test.bin

The dmesg output:

  error 4 in ld-2.31.so[7f84da4a7000+20000]

Error 4 comes from trying to access an invalid memory address.

The actual bug is triggered within _dl_relocate_object and is a null pointer dereference.
When the program gets here, rax is 0.

A curious side note is that during this specific phase of processing, ld's own stack has
RWX permissions.

:: 4.2  OOB Reads (and Writes?) - Abusing Dynamic Sections :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Entries in the dynamic section of an ELF typically contain a lot of addresses relative to
the start of a section in the binary. Through this, there are some simple changes you can
make to a binary that will cause ld to do things incorrectly, up to and including parsing
itself in memory.

To demonstrate, let's look at the .gnu.version_r section. You can read this section if it
exists using:
 
  $ readelf -V yourbinary

About this section from the LSB reference:

  Symbol definitions are contained in the special section .gnu.version_r which has a 
  section type of SHT_GNU_verneed. The number of entries in this section is contained 
  in the DT_VERNEEDNUM entry of the Dynamic Section. The sh_link member of the section 
  header points to the section that contains the strings referenced by this section.

  REF: https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/LSB_1.3.0/gLSB/gLSB/symverrqmts.html

There are two ways you can use these sections to trigger bugs, through either the main 
Elfxx_Verneed struct, or one of the Elfxx_Vernaux entries.

Here's some examples from the binary I was testing:

  ┌ Elfxx_Verneed ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ DATA        NAME         DESCRIPTION                                             │

  │ 7302 0000 ─ vna_name ─── Offset of dependency name string in the section header. │
  │ 1000 0000 ─ vna_next ─── Offset of next vernaux entry.                           │
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Verneed.vn_file is the string table offset pointing to the name of the file needed by the
binary. It's unsigned, so you can set it up to any address in the lower 32 bits of the 
virtual address. ld will then do a strcmp to check it against some other known values. 
During the strcmp both RDI and RBP are pointing to the memory location. You can trigger a
DOS condition by pointing this to an address that doesn't exist.

The Vernaux structs are parsed in a similar way. Vernaux.vna_name can point to an address
that's loaded in the process image. It s subject to similar checks and can trigger DOS 
conditions in strcmp or other functions called by _dl_check_map_versions. If the name 
can't be resolved, then ld will report that and the program will exit.

To play around with this, I added some ASCII art to the end of my binary and then resized
the last PT_LOAD section to make sure that the rest of the binary ended up in the process
image. Then I pointed a Vernaux struct to the start of the buffer, and got it to fail the
check and print out my art. Neat!

You can also take most offsets within the dynamic section, such as the entry that points
to .gnu.version_r, and point it to an offset way beyond the bounds of the file and into
the memory area where ld is. Silly experiments included tricking ld into parsing the vDSO.
These offsets are signed too, so you can move backwards and parse random parts of the ELF
header too.

There is potential to leverage these kinds of bugs for things like backdooring binaries, 
such as tricking ld with a bogus offset in the rela.dyn section and setting up an 
arbitrary address in the plt section to call whatever you want from within the newly 
set up process. Will maybe to cover some of those techniques in a future paper! Check out
elfmaster's "Preloading the linker for fun and profit" in this issue for more linker fun!

This is just a few random bugs I wanted to talk about and didn't know where else to put 
them. It's a lot easier to break instead of building, so I wanted to share a few things 
that might make things better in some way. File parsers are especially hard, and there 
will always be edge cases. The more we work to make our tools better, the more we will 
understand what's actually going on. Until then, happy hunting!
