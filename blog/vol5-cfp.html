If you've been breaking things quietly, poking at corners no one documents, or
just doing weird shit on *nix systems because it's fun, we want to hear about
it.

We don't care if your work is academic, underground, half-finished, or
borderline irresponsible. We do care that it's interesting, technical, and real.

We are looking for submissions in (but not limited to):

<center><t>Virus Techniques (VX)</t></center>
Classic or modern *nix virus techniques. Replication, infection strategies,
persistence, loaders, evasion, living-off-the-land. If it spreads or mutates,
we're interested.

<center><t>Rootkits on *nix systems</t></center>
LKM tricks, syscall madness, stealth techniques, detection bypasses, weird
kernel behaviors you abused on purpose (or by accident).

<center><t>Bootkits / Firmware Malware Firmware-level attacks targeting *nix</t></center>
UEFI, bootloaders, early boot abuse, persistence before userspace exists. If it
runs before the OS wakes up, it belongs here.

<center><t>Kernel Hax Kernel quirks</t></center>
Race conditions, side effects, odd syscalls, scheduler abuse, memory tricks,
undocumented behavior, and unintended features. The stuff that makes
maintainers sigh.

<center><t>Malware Reverse Engineering RE of *nix malware</t></center>
Implants, loaders, or frameworks. Static, dynamic, symbolic, emulation, tooling.
Write-ups that teach us how you did it, not just what it does.

<center><t>Anti-RE / Anti-Debug / Anti-Analysis / Anti-LLM Techniques</t></center>
To slow down, mislead, or break analysis pipelines. Debugger traps, time bombs,
environment checks, weird architectures, symbolic execution poison, LLM-hostile
tricks.

<center><t>File Format Hax Obfuscation, polyglots, golfing, parser abuse targeting *nix</t></center>
ELF fuckery, filesystem tricks, loader edge cases, "this shouldn't work but it
does" formats.

<center><t>Local Scenes</t></center>
What's happening where you are. Local hacker groups, underground meetups, defunct
scenes, revived scenes, weird regional tech culture.

<center><t>Computer-Generated Art</t></center>
Not AI. Code that generates visuals, sound, text, chaos. Fractals, demos,
terminals that hallucinate, cursed ASCII, mathematical art. As long as it runs
on *nix and looks sick.

<center><t>Things We Don't Care About</t></center>
  <y>X</y> Trend-chasing buzzwords.
  <y>X</y> Marketing fluff.
  <y>X</y> "Trust me bro" writeups with no technical depth.
  <y>X</y> AI generated filler.

  <y>~</y> Email your paper to <a href="mailto:stdin@tmpout.sh">stdin@tmpout.sh</a>
  <y>~</y> Be sure to include <t>[CFP 5]</t> in your email subject.
  <y>~</y> Submit text files only, in English, and wrapped to <t>78</t> columns.
  <y>~</y> We will not accept any executable binaries for submissions.
  <y>~</y> Please submit your paper by no later than <t>April 1st 2026</t>.

If you have any questions regarding submissions, contact us through X (<a href="https://twitter.com/tmpout">@tmpout</a>),
<a href="https://discord.gg/qbMZN5QbQb">Discord</a>, <a href="https://haunted.computer/@tmpout">Mastodon</a>, or via the email address mentioned above. All papers submitted
will be reviewed by our team and you will be notified if your paper was accepted
by the end of <t>April 2026</t>.

Thank you to everyone who has read, shared, and contributed to our zine!
