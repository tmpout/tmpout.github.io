  INTRO:
  As beginners on our little journey of understanding the ELF file format,
  it is important to understand the program headers, as they are essential
  for how the OS loads and executes a program. Without understanding these
  concepts it would be far more challenging to analyze, modify, or exploit
  ELF binaries effectively.

─ SEGMENT I: WHAT IS A PROGRAM HEADER? ──────────────────────────────────────

  A program or segment header tells our beloved operating system how to
  create a process image during the program execution. It describes how
  to map the segments and what permissions to set for that region. Each
  entry in the program header contains the following info:

  - segment type
  - location in the file and memory
  - permissions
  - segment size

  So by now you may be wondering:

  &gt; That's cool and all, but what even is this thing called a "segment"???

  Well allow me to clarify: A segment in an ELF is just a part of the
  program that the operating system loads into memory for execution. Each
  segment contains code, data, or some other important data required for
  the program to run.

─ SEGMENT II: WHERE DO I FIND THE PROGRAM HEADERS? ──────────────────────────

  At this point, you may be wondering where can you find these program
  headers. Do not worry, I'm here to help, if we take another look at our
  ELF header, we can see 3 important members: ──┬─┬─┐
                                                │ │ │
    typedef struct {                            │ │ │
      unsigned char     e_ident[EI_NIDENT];     │ │ │
      uint16_t          e_type;                 │ │ │
      uint16_t          e_machine;              │ │ │
      uint32_t          e_version;              │ │ │
      Elf64_Addr        e_entry;                │ │ │
      Elf64_Off         e_phoff;     &lt;──────────┘ │ │
      Elf64_Off         e_shoff;                  │ │
      uint32_t          e_flags;                  │ │
      uint16_t          e_ehsize;                 │ │
      uint16_t          e_phentsize; &lt;────────────┘ │
      uint16_t          e_phnum;     &lt;──────────────┘
      uint16_t          e_shentsize;
      uint16_t          e_shnum;
      uint16_t          e_shstrndx;
    } Elf64_Ehdr;

  The three little members stand for the following:

    e_phoff     - program header offset
    e_phentsize - size of one program header entry
    e_phnum     - the number of program headers

  With those entries we can find the first program header using the e_phoff
  and then we can loop trough the program headers by going from 1 to
  e_phnum, calculating the address of each program header by adding
  e_phentsize to e_phoff.

─ SEGMENT III: WHAT DOES THE PROGRAM HEADER CONSIST OF? ─────────────────────

  Moving on, let us take a closer look at the definition of the program
  header:

    typedef struct {
       uint32_t   p_type;
       uint32_t   p_flags;
       Elf64_Off  p_offset;
       Elf64_Addr p_vaddr;
       Elf64_Addr p_paddr;
       uint64_t   p_filesz;
       uint64_t   p_memsz;
       uint64_t   p_align;
   } Elf64_Phdr;

  The first member describes the segment type. There are, of course, many
  segment types, including architecture-specific types. To get started,
  we only need to know the 8 most common ones:

    PT_NULL         - 0 - PLACE HOLDER
    PT_LOAD         - 1 - LOADABLE SEGMENT
    PT_DYNAMIC      - 2 - INFO FOR DYNAMIC LINKING
    PT_INTERP       - 3 - LOCATION OF INTERPRETER
    PT_NOTE         - 4 - METADATA
    PT_PHDR         - 6 - LOCATION OF PROGRAM HEADER TABLE IN MEMORY
    PT_TLS          - 7 - THREAD LOCAL STORAGE INFORMATION

  The p_flags member defines the permissions for the region in a bit field
  like so:
                          ┌──────┬───────┬──────┐
                          │ READ │ WRITE │ EXEC │
                          ├──────┼───────┼──────┤
                          │   4  │   2   │  1   │
                          └──────┴───────┴──────┘

  Neeext up, p_offset, which defines the offset of the section from the
  start of the file. Right after that we have p_vaddr and p_paddr. The
  p_vaddr gives us the virtual address at which the first byte of the
  segment is located in memory and the p_paddr defines the same thing
  just for the physical address, although the p_paddr is rarely used.

  Finally, we have p_filesz and p_memsz, so as you could probably assume,
  p_filesz and p_memsz define the size of the segment in the binary and in
  memory respectively. Note that sometimes the p_memsz may be larger than
  p_filesz. A huge difference between the two could mean the segment is
  packed (commonly seen in malware).

  Now all that is left is the p_align member. It makes sure all our
  segments are properly aligned in memory and on disk. To ensure this it
  has 3 rules:

    1. The p_vaddr and p_offset must be aligned based on the systems
       page size.

    2. If p_align is 0 or 1, no alignment is needed.

    3. If p_align is larger than 1, it must be a power of 2, and
       p_vaddr and p_offset should match when divided by this alignment
       value.

  So to summarize it makes sure it's just loaded in the correct boundaries.

─ SEGMENT IV: CONCLUSION ───────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Well that is all for this time, I hope you enjoyed the read and hope that
  the article has helped you in understanding the ELF program headers in
  some way. Now go out there and have fun with the newly learned knowledge!

  I'm also a very big fan of utilizing the knowledge that I learned directly
  so as a suggestion, you can try to parse the program headers now!

─ EXTRA SEGMENT V: VISUALISATION OF PT_NOTE TO PT_LOAD INFECTION ───────────

  Here's a little extra part for ya. If you ever wondered what changes
  in the program header during the PT_NOTE to PT_LOAD infection:

    BEFORE:                           AFTER:
    Elf64_Phdr.p_type   = 0x4         Elf64_Phdr.p_type   = 0x1
    Elf64_Phdr.p_flags  = 0x4         Elf64_Phdr.p_flags  = 0x5
    Elf64_Phdr.p_vaddr  = 0x0000      Elf64_Phdr.p_vaddr  = 0xc000000 + F_sz
    Elf64_Phdr.p_filesz = 0x0000      Elf64_Phdr.p_filesz = V-Body
    Elf64_Phdr.p_memsz  = 0x0000      Elf64_Phdr.p_memsz  = V-Body
    Elf64_Phdr.p_offset = 0x0000      Elf64_Phdr.p_offset = F_sz

    F_sz = file size,   V-Body = virus body,  0x0000 = some unknown value
